# Deploys

I have deployed my project to Vercel and to Render.com

* Vercel: https://dream-vacations.vercel.app
* Render.com: https://dream-vacations.onrender.com

***MIND THAT: When you first open it you have to wait a little bit because after the first request the back-end needs time to start***

Also I have deployed the front-end (client) of my project to Firebase

* Firebase: https://dream-vacations-2024.web.app ---BUT in this case to work properly(because it's just the front-end) you have to start the server -- 
```
cd server
node server.js
```

# How to run the application:

First you have to clone my project:

```
git clone https://github.com/vilianakovacheva/Dream-Vacations.git
```

Then in the terminal write ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies for this project.

When you have installed the dependencies, write in the terminal:
```
cd client
npm run dev
```

When you run the project, you have to start the server, so my project works properly
<br>
Write in the terminal:
```
cd server
node server.js
```
And then open the link from your terminal that appeared after you typed ```npm run dev``` so you can see my project.
